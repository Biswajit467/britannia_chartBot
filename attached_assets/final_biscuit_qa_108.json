    "question": "When changing the rejection belt:",
    "answer": "Remove the MS frame clamps using an Allen key. After changing the belt, place the frame back in the same marked position as before to maintain alignment. 3. Monthly / Quarterly Maintenance Every month or every 3 months, check whether the nozzles are becoming loose. During line breaks, clean the camera lens properly. Also, clean dust or oil from the top of the frame using air spray across the entire frame. 4. Daily Check – Air Supply Every day, check if the air connections are supplying proper air to the rejection system. 5. Handling Bulk or Stuck Biscuits In rare cases, if biscuits come in bulk or get stuck, use the easy adjustable rejection nozzle system. Adjust it using a 6mm Allen key for smooth biscuit flow and proper rejection."
